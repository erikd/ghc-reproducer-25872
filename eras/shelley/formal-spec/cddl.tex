\section{CBOR Serialization Specification}
\label{sec:cddl}

Our CBOR (RFC 7049 \cite{rfcCBOR})
serialization scheme is specified using
CDDL (RFC 8610 \cite{rfcCDDL}).

The CDDL specification is located at
\url{https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-ledger/tree/master/eras/shelley/impl/cddl-files}.

% TODO - Include the CDDL spec inline?
% \lstinputlisting[backgroundcolor = \color{lightgray}]{../impl/cddl-files/shelley.cddl}

Note that the ledger does
\textbf{not support a canonical representation}.
This is an intentional decision to discourage people from
checking signatures and hashes on re-serialized data.
